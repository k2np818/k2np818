Learning 
I am a beginner (sort of) working with servos and the Arduino redboard. 
I am also a model train guy. 
Which has lead me to this site.
I need to build a lift for my train to raise it to another level (limited space in the basement) 
A reguler servo works but it does not have enough tork so I puchased a RC servo which does. 
This RC requires more frequencies wehn sending the signal so In need to look at the RCARDUINO FastLib
